# Diamond Valuation Project

This project involves estimating the value of stolen diamonds using a dataset containing detailed information about tens of thousands of diamonds. You'll develop a predictive model to estimate diamond prices based on characteristics like carat, cut, color, and clarity. The goal is to provide an accurate valuation of the missing diamonds based on the provided data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on over 50,000 diamonds, with the majority of data originating from the American continent.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and clean any anomalies or missing values.
2. Model Building: Develop a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on the given features.
3. Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate its predictions.
